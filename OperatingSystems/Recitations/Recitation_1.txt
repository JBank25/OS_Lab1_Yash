We need to set up a virtual machine to let us run linux. PINTOS only
runs on Linux. VirtualBox is probably best for me (MacOS)

Tutorial for getting virtual machine provided by them. 

Basic linux commabds:
    ls, touch, vim, cat, rm, pwd


What is an OS?
    OS= resource manager that allows us to easily access/use resources on
    the computer. Memory, file system, devices, etc. It is code between applicatoin
    and hardware layers. Provides API to user programs in the form of system 
    calls. 

Shell = outermost layer of an OS. The user interface to the OS. Bash shell is
default fo linux system. 



File redirection is the first thing we need to implement for project.
Seems farily straightforward upon review with TA's

Piping is a way we can connect two applications in the OS.
